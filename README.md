 👋 Hi, I'm Eray. ↓

I have been with this world since the first day I started school. Of course, at first, this association was just playing games.

When I was in high school, my only thought was to go deep into computers. I had to learn software and fulfill my dreams.

I failed classes, I cried with anger, but I wrote a lot of code and finally I was able to project on the screen what I had imagined. "Hello, my world." I didn't give up!

It's hard for me to jump out of this world now.

🧡 Things I'm passionate about 💙

🤔 Problem - Solving : I feel like a detective when I solve problems. Problems can come from anywhere! And I am always ready. I can break the problem into multiple parts, analyze them one by one, put them together and come to a conclusion.

❓ Project Deficiencies ➛ I'm : I think a project down to the finest detail and create it in accordance with the sector and new technologies. Wherever there is a gap, I am there!

🤝 Solidarity : There is no age or limit to learning. This software world should be outside the world we live in. We should help each other more and share knowledge. We should be happy. 😊
