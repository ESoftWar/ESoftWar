 # Hi, I'm Eray MENEKŞE so @ESoftWar.

 ## About me
 I was born in `2001` in Bursa. I still live in `Bursa`. During the years I studied at `Tophane Vocational and Technical Anatolian High School`, I started to be interested in software and decided to  progress in the field of `Information Technologies`. Then I studied `Database Programming`. I acquired `C#` and `SQL` programming language skills. Then I studied `Computer Programming` at `Istanbul  University - Cerrahpaşa.` I continued to progress by adding new ones to my high school skills. Currently, by adopting `SOLID` principles, I am working on `software solutions` such as `Commercial  Automations`, `Hospital Systems`, `Barcode Market Systems` through `C#` programming language in the field of `.Net Technologies`. I am proficient in `MSSQL` and `advanced T-SQL`, `Oracle SQL` and `advanced PL/SQL` languages, technologies and databases. Thanks to my technical skills, different `work experiences` and `teamwork`, I believe that I will work `solution-oriented` and finalize the given task `in the best way`, benefit `myself` and `my colleagues` and make the best use of the time allocated to us. I want to collaborate with fellow `software developers` and `improve myself`. These shares are also available on this platform.
